<p>Josiah Dahl is a highly motivated individual who thrives in a logical and tech driven environment. Jo (as he’s known) prides himself on having a strong work ethic and being attentive to detail. Jo graduated from the University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford, BC in 2015 with an Associates Degree in Computer Information Systems. He is a mainly self-taught web developer who has worked with clients that range from small startups to thriving businesses.</p>
<p>For Jo, the best part about working in web development is that the boundaries of the field are yet to be known, there is always new code to learn, new design paradigms to implement, and new challenges to face.</p>
<p>When Jo isn’t coding, working with clients, or learning something new, he spends his time with his wife and their friends in Orange County, CA. He enjoys going on hikes, being outdoors, and working towards his goals in physical fitness.
