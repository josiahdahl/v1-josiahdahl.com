<p class="portfolio-text">
    Madness Cup is an online "March Madness" style voting game where users can vote for their favorite rival in each competition. Rivals move through four rounds of
    voting until only one is left. Additional features include a trivia mini-game built with Vue.js, historical competition information, and admin-editable content areas.
