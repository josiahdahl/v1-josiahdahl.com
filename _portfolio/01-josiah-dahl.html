<p class="portfolio-text">I've always loved the concept of Material Design. Ever since I heard of <a href="http://materializecss.com">Materialize CSS</a> I knew I had to one day utilize it. While it is a bit different from the semantic SCSS I like to write and more along the lines of basic Bootstrap and Foundation, it is easy to implement and very customizable through SCSS variables.</p>

<p class="portfolio-text">In addition to Materialize CSS, I have used Jekyll for the first time. Previously, I used Foundation's 'Panini' to create a static site for my wedding. Jekyll is much more powerful and, combined with Gulp, makes for a very easy and fast build process. I look forward to using it more in the future.</p>
